Hi!👋

My name is Arseniiy, and I believe that the above quote from Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" describes the specifics of modern web development in the best possible way 😄

I'm a passionate web developer, striving for continuous learning and personal growth, an active and self-motivated team player, constantly striving for improvement. 

I specialise in Python (Django, Django REST framework), JavaScript (React, Node.js) and PHP (Symfony). 

My diverse background also includes legal counselling and management experience👨‍💼👨‍⚖️
