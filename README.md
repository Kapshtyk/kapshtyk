Hi!👋

My name is Arseniiy, and I believe that the above quote from Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" describes the specifics of modern web development in the best possible way 😄

I'm a hardworking, proactive, and self-motivated developer with over 2 years of programming experience. I value continuous learning, challenging myself and looking for opportunities to grow.

I specialise in Python (Django, Django REST framework, FastAPI), JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Next.js, Node.js, NestJS) and PHP (Symfony, Drupal 10). 

My diverse background also includes legal counselling and management experience👨‍💼👨‍⚖️
